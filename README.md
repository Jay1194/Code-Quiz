# Code-Quiz

## Description
The objective behind this application was to develop a timed coding quiz encompassing a range of multiple-choice questions. 
Operating within the browser environment, this app employs several web APIs. It effectively showcases my adeptness in utilizing
the DOM API and showcases the implementation of dynamic HTML and CSS transformations driven by JavaScript code. The end result 
boasts a sleek, refined, and adaptable user interface.
